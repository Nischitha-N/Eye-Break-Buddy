# 👁️ Eye Break Buddy

**Take care of your eyes, one 20-second break at a time.**  
Eye Break Buddy is a minimalist Chrome/Brave extension that gently reminds you to rest your eyes every 20 minutes — with adorable animal mascots and quirky puns that you can't ignore.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Too much screen time strains your eyes, affects focus, and leads to burnout.  
The **20-20-20 rule** (every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds) is a science-backed way to reduce digital eye strain.  
This extension turns that rule into something *fun*, *cute*, and *actually effective*.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Every 20 minutes, a dark overlay appears.
2. A random **animal mascot** and **punny message** is displayed.
3. Any media playing (videos, audio) **pauses**.
4. After 20 seconds, or on manual close, the overlay disappears, media resumes, and your **streak gets updated**.
