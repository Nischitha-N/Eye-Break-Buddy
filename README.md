# 👁️ Eye Break Buddy

**Take care of your eyes, one 20-second break at a time.**  
Eye Break Buddy is a minimalist Chrome/Brave extension that gently reminds you to rest your eyes every 20 minutes using adorable animal mascots and quirky eye-care puns.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Too much screen time strains your eyes, affects focus, and leads to burnout.  
Following the **20-20-20 rule** (every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds) helps reduce digital eye strain.  
This extension makes that rule *fun*, *cute*, and *impossible to ignore*.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Every 20 minutes, a dark overlay appears.
2. A random **mascot image** and **eye-care pun** is shown.
3. All media (videos/audios) on the page **pause**.
4. After 20 seconds (or if manually closed), the overlay disappears, media resumes, and your **streak** is recorded.
